# SkipList
Assignment 1 of AAA.

## Node.py:
A somewhat special node as it is designed for use in skip list, in addition to having two pointers it has three (next, previous and down).
This class is used by SortedLinkList, but is somewhat different to a regular link list node.

## SortedLinkList.py:
Python doesn't provide it's own representation of LinkList, further we required a special type of Link list, where the values were inserted in a sorted order

## SkipList.py:
SkipList Class and SkipListNode Class  
SkipListNode is a special node made for SkipList as each node represents a list on a level in the skiplist
